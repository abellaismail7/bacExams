# BacExams
android app created for students in morocco so they can access national exams from 2011 to 2019 whatever their orient is.
### I use
To bring this app to life i used :
1. Kotlin: We need kotlin/Coroutines, without it this project would never exist.
2. koin: For dependency injection, I used to use dagger but, why not to try something different ? koin is easy to use just after 5 mins you will ready.  but, I don't think that it will be a good choice for bigger projects .
3. Architecture Components: the most important part. those libraries is just an incredible idea from google, thanks for what they done.
4. PDF library for android.
5. Firebase (Analytics,Ads,Cloud messaging,Storage).
6. Retrofit: HTTP library.
7. Coil: An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
### Test
Not tested at all. Google already recommended test-driven way. but I was lazy ^_^.
